; The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed
; by making use of the approximation sin x â‰ˆ x if x is
; sufficiently small, and the trigonometic identity

; to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of
; this exercise an angle is considered "sufficiently small" if
; its magnitude is not great than 0.1 radians.) These ideas
; are incorporated in the following procedures:

(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (since angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
    angle
    (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

; a. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine
; 12.15) is evaluated?

; b. What is the order of growth in space and number of
; steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated 
; by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?
